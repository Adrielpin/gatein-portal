   <title>Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP)</title>

   <sect1>
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>The Web Services for Remote Portlets specification defines a web service interface for accessing and
         interacting with interactive presentation-oriented web services. It has been produced through the efforts of
         the Web Services for Remote Portlets (WSRP) OASIS Technical Committee. It is based on the requirements
         gathered and on the concrete proposals made to the committee.

      <para>Scenarios that motivate WSRP functionality include:

      <title>Level of support in &PRODUCT;</title>
      <para>The WSRP Technical Committee defined
         <ulink url="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/3073">WSRP Use Profiles</ulink>
         to help with WSRP interoperability. We will refer to terms defined in that document in
         this section.
      </para>

      <para>&PRODUCT; provides a Simple level of support for our WSRP Producer except that out-of-band registration
         is not currently handled. We support in-band registration and persistent local state (which are
         defined at the Complex level).
      </para>

      <para>On the Consumer side, &PRODUCT; provides a Medium level of support for WSRP, except that we only handle
         HTML markup (as &PRODUCT; itself doesn't handle other markup types). We do support explicit portlet cloning and
         we fully support the PortletManagement interface.
      </para>

      <para>As far as caching goes, we have Level 1 Producer and Consumer. We support Cookie handling properly on the
         Consumer and our Producer requires initialization of cookies (as we have found that it improved interoperabilty
         with some consumers). We don't support custom window states or modes, as Portal doesn't either. We do, however,
         support CSS on both the Producer (though it's more a function of the portlets than inherent Producer
         capability) and Consumer.
      </para>

      <para>While we provide a complete implementation of WSRP 1.0, we do need to go through the
         <ulink url="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/6018">Conformance statements</ulink>
         and perform more interoperability testing (an area that needs to be better supported by the WSRP Technical
         Committee and Community at large).

      <para>
         &PRODUCT; provides a complete support of WSRP 1.0 standard interfaces and offers both consumer and producer
         services. WSRP support is provided by the

         service archive, if you've obtained &PRODUCT; from a binary
         distribution. If you don't intend on using WSRP, we recommend that you remove
         <filename>portal-wspr.sar</filename>
         from the main
         <filename>jboss-portal.sar</filename>
         service archive.

      <title>Making a portlet remotable</title>
      <para>&PRODUCT; does<emphasis role="bold">NOT</emphasis>, by default, expose local portlets for consumption by
         remote WSRP consumers. In order to make a portlet remotely available, it must be made "remotable" by adding a
         <literal>remotable</literal>
         element to the
         <filename>jboss-portlet.xml</filename>
         deployment descriptor for
         that portlet. If a
         <filename>jboss-portlet.xml</filename>
         file does not exist, one must be added to the
         <filename>WEB-INF</filename>
         folder of the web application containing the portlet.
      </para>
      <para>In the following example, the "BasicPortlet" portlet is specified as being remotable. The
         <literal>remotable</literal>
         element is optional.
      </para>
      <example>
         <title>BasicPortlet</title>
         <programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
<!DOCTYPE portlet-app PUBLIC "-//&PRODUCT;//DTD JBoss Portlet 2.6//EN"
          "http://www.jboss.org/portal/dtd/jboss-portlet_2_6.dtd">
<portlet-app>
   <portlet>
      <portlet-name>BasicPortlet</portlet-name>
      <remotable>true</remotable>
   </portlet>
</portlet-app>]]></programlisting>
      </example>
      <para>
         It is also possible to specify that all the portlets declared within a given
         <filename>jboss-portlet.xml</filename>
         file have a specific "remotable" status by default. This is done by adding a single
         <literal>remotable</literal>
         element to the root
         <literal>portlet-app</literal>
         element. Usually, this feature will be used to remotely expose
         several portlets without having to specify the status for all the declared portlets. Let's look at an example:
      </para>
      <example>
         <title>All portlets set remotable</title>
         <programlisting><![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="yes"?>
<!DOCTYPE portlet-app PUBLIC
   "-//&PRODUCT;//DTD JBoss Portlet 2.6//EN"
   "http://www.jboss.org/portal/dtd/jboss-portlet_2_6.dtd">
<portlet-app>
   <remotable>true</remotable>
   <portlet>
      <portlet-name>RemotelyExposedPortlet</portlet-name>
      ...
   </portlet>
   <portlet>
      <portlet-name>NotRemotelyExposedPortlet</portlet-name>
      <remotable>false</remotable>
      ...
   </portlet>
</portlet-app>]]>
         </programlisting>
      </example>

      <para>
         In the example above, we defined two portlets with a default "remotable" status set to true. This means that
         all portlets defined in this descriptor are, by default, exposed remotely by &PRODUCT;'s WSRP producer.
         Note, however, that it is possible to override the default behavior by adding a
         <literal>remotable</literal>
         element to a portlet description. In that case, the "remotable" status defined by the portlet takes precedence
         over the default. In the example above, the
         <varname>RemotelyExposedPortlet</varname>
         inherits the "remotable"
         status defined by default since it does not specify a
         <literal>remotable</literal>
         element in its description.
         The<varname>NotRemotelyExposedPortlet</varname>, however, overrides the default behavior and is not remotely
         exposed. Note that in the absence of a top-level
         <literal>remotable</literal>
         element, portlets are NOT
         remotely exposed.

      <title>Consuming &PRODUCT;'s WSRP portlets from a remote Consumer</title>
      <para>WSRP Consumers vary a lot as far as how they are configured. Most of them require that you either specify
         the URL for the Producer's WSDL definition or the URLs for the individual endpoints. Please refer to your
         Consumer's documentation for specific instructions. For instructions on how to do so in &PRODUCT;, please
         refer to<xref linkend="consumer_configuration"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
         &PRODUCT;'s Producer is automatically set up when you deploy a portal instance with the WSRP service.
         You can access the WSDL file at
         <filename>http://{hostname}:{port}/portal-wsrp/MarkupService?wsdl</filename>. You can access the endpoint URLs
         at:

      <sect2>
         <title>Overview</title>
         <para>
            To be able to consume WSRP portlets exposed by a remote producer, &PRODUCT;'s WSRP consumer needs to know
            how to access that remote producer. One can configure access to a remote producer using WSRP Producer
            descriptors. Alternatively, a portlet is provided to configure remote producers.
         </para>
         <para>
            Once a remote producer has been configured, it can be made available
            in the list of portlet providers in the Management portlet on the Admin page of &PRODUCT;. You can then
            examine the list of portlets that are exposed by this producer and configure the portlets just like you
            would for local portlets.
         </para>
         <para>
            &PRODUCT;'s default configuration exposes some of the sample portlets for remote consumption. As a way to
            test the WSRP service, a default consumer has been configured to consume these portlets. To make sure that
            the service indeed works, check that there is a portlet provider with the
            <literal>self</literal>
            identifier in the portlet providers list in the Management portlet of the Admin page. All local portlets
            marked as remotable are exposed as remote portlets via the
            <literal>self</literal>
            portlet
            provider so that you can check that they work as expected with WSRP. The
            <filename>portal-wsrp.sar</filename>
            file contains a WSRP Producer descriptor (<filename>default-wsrp.xml</filename>) that configures this
            default producer. This file can be edited or removed if needed.
         </para>

      <sect2>
         <title>Configuring a remote producer walk-through</title>
         <para>
            Let's work through the steps of defining access to a remote producer so that its portlets can be
            consumed within &PRODUCT;. We will configure access to BEA's public WSRP producer. We will first examine
            how to do so using the configuration portlet. We will then show how the same result can be accomplish with
            a producer descriptor.
         </para>

         <sect3 id="consumer_gui">
            <title>Using the configuration portlet</title>
            <para>
               As of Portal 2.6, a configuration portlet is provided to configure access to remote WSRP Producers
               grahically. You can access it at
               <filename>http://{hostname}:{port}/portal/auth/portal/admin/WSRP</filename>
               or by logging in as a Portal administrator and clicking on the WSRP tab in the Admin portal. If all went
               well, you should see something similar to this:
               <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                     <imagedata fileref="images/wsrp/config_init.png" format="PNG" align="center" valign="middle"
                                scalefit="1"/>
                  </imageobject>
               </mediaobject>
               This screen presents all the configured producers associated with their status and possible actions on
               them. A Consumer can be active or inactive. Activating a Consumer means that it is ready to act as a
               portlet provider. Deactivating it will remove it from the list of available portlet providers. Note also
               that a Consumer can be marked as requiring refresh meaning that the information held about it might not
               be up to date and refreshing it from the remote Producer might be a good idea. This can happen for
               several reasons: the service description for that remote Producer has not been fetched yet, the cached
               version has expired or modifications have been made to the configuration that could potentially
               invalidate it, thus requiring re-validation of the information.
            </para>

            <para>
               Next, we create a new Consumer which we will call<literal>bea</literal>. Type "<literal>bea</literal>" in
               the "Create a consumer named:" field then click on "Create consumer":
               <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                     <imagedata fileref="images/wsrp/config_create.png" format="PNG" align="center" valign="middle"
                                scalefit="1"/>
                  </imageobject>
               </mediaobject>
               You should now see a form allowing you to enter/modify the information about the Consumer.
               Set the cache expiration value to 300 seconds and enter the WSDL URL for the producer in the text field
               and press the "Refresh &amp; Save" button:
               <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                     <imagedata fileref="images/wsrp/config_usewsdl.png" format="PNG" align="center" valign="middle"
                                scalefit="1"/>
                  </imageobject>
               </mediaobject>
               This will retrieve the service description associated with the Producer which WSRP is described by the
               WSDL file found at the URL you just entered. In our case, querying the service description will allow us
               to learn that the Producer requires registration and that it expects a value for the registration
               property named<literal>registration/consumerRole</literal>:
               <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                     <imagedata fileref="images/wsrp/config_refresh.png" format="PNG" align="center" valign="middle"
                                scalefit="1"/>
                  </imageobject>
               </mediaobject>
               <note><para>At this point, there is no automated way to learn about which possible values (if any) are
                  expected by the remote Producer. In the case of BEA's public producer, the possible values are
                  indicated in the registration property description. This is not always the case... Please refer to
                  the specific Producer's documentation.</para>
               </note>
               Enter "<literal>public</literal>" as the value for the registration property and press "Save &amp;
               Refresh" once more. You should now
               see something similar to:
               <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                     <imagedata fileref="images/wsrp/config_end.png" format="PNG" align="center" valign="middle"
                                scalefit="1"/>
                  </imageobject>
               </mediaobject>
               The Consumer for the
               <literal>bea</literal>
               Producer should now be available as a portlet provider and
               is ready to be used.
            </para>
            <para>
               A producer is configured, by default, by retrieving the producer's information via a WSDL URL. There are
               rare cases, however, where URLs need to be provided for each of the producer's end points. You can do
               exactly that by unchecking the "Use WSDL?" checkbox, as is the case for the
               <literal>self</literal>
               producer:

               This producer descriptor gives access to BEA's public WSRP producer. We will look at the details of the
               different elements later. Note for now the
               <literal>producer-id</literal>
               element with a "<literal>bea</literal>" value. Put this file in the deploy directory and start the server
               (with &PRODUCT; and its WSRP service deployed).

            <title>Configuring access to a remote portlet</title>
            <para>
               Let's now look at the Admin page and the Management portlet. Click on the "Portlet definitions" tab at
               the
               top. Once this is done, look at the list of available portlet providers. If all went well,
               you should see something similar to this:
               <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                     <imagedata fileref="images/wsrp/portlets.png" format="PNG" align="center" valign="middle"
                                scalefit="1"/>
                  </imageobject>
               </mediaobject>
            </para>
            <para>
               We have 3 available portlet providers:
               <literal>local, self</literal>
               and<literal>bea</literal>. The
               <literal>local</literal>
               portlet provider exposes all the portlets deployed in this particular instance of Portal. As
               explained above, the
               <literal>self</literal>
               provider refers to the default WSRP consumer bundled with Portal that consumes
               the portlets exposed by the default WSRP producer. The
               <literal>bea</literal>
               provider corresponds to BEA's public producer
               we just configured. Select it and click on "View portlets". You should now see something similar to:
               <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                     <imagedata fileref="images/wsrp/bea.png" format="PNG" align="center" valign="middle" scalefit="1"/>
                  </imageobject>
               </mediaobject>
            </para>
            <para>
               From there on out, you should be able to configure WSRP portlets just as any other. In particular, you
               can create an instance of one of the remote portlets offered by BEA's public producer just like you would
               create an instance of a local portlet and then assign it to a window in a page. If you go to that page,
               you should see something similar to below for this portlet:
               <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                     <imagedata fileref="images/wsrp/result.png" format="PNG" align="center" valign="middle"/>

         <title>WSRP Producer descriptors</title>

         <para>
            A WSRP Producer descriptor is an XML file which name ends in
            <filename>-wsrp.xml</filename>
            and
            which can be dropped in the deploy directory of the JBoss application server or nested in .sar files. It is
            possible to configure access to several different producers within a single descriptor or use one file per
            producer, depending on your needs. An XML Schema for the WSRP Producer descriptor format can be found at
            <filename>jboss-portal.sar/portal-wsrp.sar/xsd/jboss-wsrp-consumer_2_6.xsd</filename>, while a (legacy) DTD
            can be found at<filename>jboss-portal.sar/portal-wsrp.sar/dtd/jboss-wsrp-consumer_2_6.dtd</filename>.

            <note><para>It is important to note how WSRP Producer descriptors are processed. They are read the first time the
               WSRP service starts and the associated information is then put in the Portal database. Subsequent launch
               of the WSRP service will use the database-stored information for all producers which identifier is
               already known to Portal. More specifically, all the descriptors are scanned for producer identifiers.
               Any identifier that is already known will be bypassed and the configuration associated with this remote
               producer in the database will be used. If a producer identifier is found that wasn't already in the
               database, that producer information will be processed and recorded in the database. Therefore, if you
               wish to delete a producer configuration, you need to delete the associated information in the database
               (this can be accomplished using the configuration portlet as we saw in<xref linkend="consumer_gui"/>)
               <emphasis>AND</emphasis>
               remove the associated information in any WSRP Producer descriptor (if such
               information exists) as the producer will be re-created the next time the WSRP is launched if that
               information is not removed.</para>

         <sect3>
            <title>Required configuration information</title>

            <para>Let's now look at which information needs to be provided to configure access to a remote producer.
            </para>

            <para>First, we need to provide an identifier for the producer we are configuring so that we can refer to it
               afterwards. This is accomplished via the mandatory
               <literal>id</literal>
               attribute of the
               <literal>&lt;wsrp-producer&gt;</literal>
               element.
            </para>

            <para>&PRODUCT; also needs to learn about the remote producer's endpoints to be able to connect to the
               remote web services and perform WSRP invocations. Two options are currently supported to provide this
               information:
            </para>

            <para>
               <itemizedlist>
                  <listitem><para>You can provide the URLs for each of the different WSRP interfaces offered by the remote
                     producer via the
                     <literal>&lt;endpoint-config&gt;</literal>
                     element and its
                     <literal>&lt;service-description-url&gt;</literal>,

                     and
                     <literal>&lt;portlet-management-url&gt;</literal>
                     children. These URLs are
                     producer-specific so you will need to refer to your producer documentation or WSDL file to
                     determine
                     the appropriate values.</para>
                  </listitem>
                  <listitem><para>Alternatively, and this is the easiest way to configure your producer, you can provide a URL
                     pointing to the WSDL description of the producer's WSRP services. This is accomplished via the
                     <literal>&lt;endpoint-wsdl-url&gt;</literal>
                     element. &PRODUCT; will then
                     heuristically determine, from the information contained in the WSDL file, how to connect
                     appropriately
                     to the remote WSRP services.</para>
                     <note><para>It is important to note that, when using this method, &PRODUCT; will try to match a port
                        name to an interface based solely on the provided name. There are no standard names for these
                        ports so it is possible (though rare) that this matching process fails. In this case, you should
                        look at the WSDL file and provide the endpoint URLs manually, as per the previous method.</para>

               attribute and either
               <literal>&lt;endpoint-config&gt;</literal>
               or
               <literal>&lt;endpoint-wsdl-url&gt;</literal>
               elements
               are required for a functional remote producer configuration.

         </sect3>

         <sect3>
            <title>Optional configuration</title>
            <para>It is also possible to provide addtional configuration, which, in some cases, might be important to
               establish a proper connection to the remote producer.
            </para>

            <para>One such optional configuration concerns caching. To prevent useless roundtrips between the local
               consumer and the remote producer, it is possible to cache some of the information sent by the producer
               (such
               as the list of offered portlets) for a given duration. The rate at which the information is refreshed is
               defined by the
               <literal>expiration-cache</literal>
               attribute of the
               <literal>&lt;wsrp-producer&gt;</literal>
               element which specifies the
               refreshing period in seconds. For example, providing a value of 120 for expiration-cache means that the
               producer information will not be refreshed for 2 minutes after it has been somehow accessed. If no value
               is provided, &PRODUCT; will always access the remote producer regardless of whether the remote
               information has changed or not. Since, in most instances, the information provided by the producer does
               not
               change often, we recommend that you use this caching facility to minimize bandwidth usage.
            </para>

            <para>Additionally, some producers require consumers to register with them before authorizing them to access
               their offered portlets. If you know that information beforehand, you can provide the required
               registration
               information in the producer configuration so that the Portal consumer can register with the remote
               producer when required.
               <note>
                  <para>At this time, though, only simple String properties are supported and it is not possible to
                  configure complex registration data. This should however be sufficient for most cases.</para>
               </note>
            </para>

            <para>Registration configuration is done via the
               <literal>&lt;registration-data&gt;</literal>
               element. Since &PRODUCT; can generate the mandatory information for you, if the remote producer does
               not
               require any registration properties, you only need to provide an empty
               <literal>&lt;registration-data&gt;</literal>
               element. Values for the registration properties
               required by the remote producer can be provided via
               <literal>&lt;property&gt;</literal>
               elements. See the example below for more details. Additionally, you can override the default consumer
               name
               automatically provided by &PRODUCT; via the
               <literal>&lt;consumer-name&gt;</literal>
               element. If you choose to provide a consumer name, please remember that this should uniquely identify
               your
               consumer.

            <para>
               Producers often offer several levels of service depending on consumers' subscription levels (for
               example).
               This is implemented at the WSRP level with the registration concept: producers assert which level of
               service to provide to consumers based on the values of given registration properties.
            </para>
            <para>
               It is therefore sometimes necessary to modify the registration that concretizes the service agreement
               between a consumer and a producer. An example of easily available producer offering different level of
               services is BEA's public producer. We configured access to that producer in
               <xref linkend="consumer_gui"/>.
               If you recall, the producer was requiring registration and required a value to be provided for the
               <literal>registration/consumerRole</literal>
               property. The description of that property indicated that
               three values were possible:<literal>public</literal>,
               <literal>partner</literal>
               or
               <literal>insider</literal>
               each corresponding to a different service level. We registered using the
               <literal>public</literal>
               service level. This gave us access to three portlets as shown here:
               <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                     <imagedata fileref="images/wsrp/bea.png" format="png" align="center" valign="middle" scalefit="1"/>
                  </imageobject>
               </mediaobject>
            </para>
            <para>
               Suppose now that we would like to upgrade our service level to the "insider" level. We will need to
               tell BEA's producer that our registration data has been modified. Let's see how to do this. Assuming you
               have configured access to the producer as previously described, please go to the configuration screen for
               the
               <literal>bea</literal>
               producer and modify the value of the
               <literal>registration/consumerRole</literal>
               to
               <literal>insider</literal>

               Click on this new button and, if everything went well and your updated registration has been accepted by

            <para>
               It can also happen that a producer administrator decided to require more information from registered
               consumers. In this case, invoking operations on the producer will fail with an
               <exceptionname>OperationFailedFault</exceptionname>. &PRODUCT; will attempt to help you in this
               situation. Let's walk through an example using the
               <literal>self</literal>
               producer. Let's assume that
               registration is required without any registration properties (as is the case by default). If you go to
               the configuration screen for this producer, you should see:
               <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                     <imagedata fileref="images/wsrp/config_self.png" format="png" align="center" valign="middle"
                                scalefit="1"/>
                  </imageobject>
               </mediaobject>

               Now suppose that the administrator of the producer now requires a value to be provided for an
               <literal>email</literal>
               registration property. We will actually see how to do perform this operation
               in &PRODUCT; when we examine how to configure Portal's producer in<xref linkend="producer_config"/>.
               Operations with this producer will now fail. If you suspect that a registration modification is required,
               you should go to the configuration screen for this remote producer and refresh the information held by
               the consumer by pressing "Refresh &amp; Save":
               <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>

                  </imageobject>
               </mediaobject>

               As you can see, the configuration screen now shows the currently held registration information and
               the expected information from the producer. Enter a value for the
               <literal>email</literal>
               property
               and then click on "Modify registration". If all went well and the producer accepted your new registration
               data, you should see something similar to:
               <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>

            There are rare cases where it might be required to erase the local information without being able to
            deregister first. This is the case when a consumer is registered with a producer that has been modified by
            its administrator to not require registration anymore. If that ever was to happen (most likely, it won't),
            you can erase the local registration information from the consumer so that it can resume interacting with
            the remote producer. To do so, click on "Erase local registration" button next to the registration context
            information on the consumer configuration screen:

            You can configure the behavior of Portal's WSRP Producer by using the WSRP administration interface, which

         <title>Default configuration</title>
         <para>
            The default producer configuration is to require that consumers register with it before providing access its
            services but does not require any specific registration properties (apart from what is mandated by the
            WSRP standard). It does, however, require consumers to be registered before sending them a full service
            description. This means that our WSRP producer will not provide the list of offered portlets and other
            capabilities to unregistered consumers. The producer also uses the default
            <classname>RegistrationPolicy</classname>
            paired with the default
            <classname>RegistrationPropertyValidator</classname>. We will look into property
            validators in greater detail later in<xref linkend="registration-configuration"/>. Suffice to say for now
            that this allows users to customize how Portal's WSRP Producer decides whether a given registration property
            is valid or not.
         </para>
         <para>
            &PRODUCT; 2.6.3 introduces a web interface to configure the producer's behavior. You can access it
            by clicking on the "Producer Configuration" tab of the "WSRP" page of the "admin" portal. Here's what you
            should see with the default configuration:

               </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
            As would be expected, you can specify whether or not the producer will send the full service description to
            unregistered consumers, and, if it requires registration, which
            <classname>RegistrationPolicy</classname>
            to
            use (and, if needed, which<classname>RegistrationPropertyValidator</classname>), along with required
            registration property description for which consumers must provide acceptable values to successfully
            register.

      <sect2 id="registration-configuration">
         <title>Registration configuration</title>
         <para>
            In order to require consumers to register with Portal's producer before interacting with it, you need to
            configure Portal's behavior with respect to registration. Registration is optional, as are registration
            properties. The producer can require registration without requiring consumers to pass any registration
            properties as is the case in the default configuration. Let's configure our producer starting with a blank
            state:
            <mediaobject>
               <imageobject>
                  <imagedata fileref="images/wsrp/producer_blank.png" format="png" align="center" valign="middle"

               </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
            We will allow unregistered consumers to see the list of offered portlets so we leave the first checkbox
            ("Access to full service description requires consumers to be registered.") unchecked. We will, however,
            specify that consumers will need to be registered to be able to interact with our producer. Check the second
            checkbox ("Requires registration. Modifying this information will trigger invalidation of consumer
            registrations."). The screen should now refresh and display:
            <mediaobject>
               <imageobject>
                  <imagedata fileref="images/wsrp/producer_registration.png" format="png" align="center"
                             valign="middle" scalefit="1"/>
               </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
            You can specify the fully-qualified name for your
            <classname>RegistrationPolicy</classname>
            and
            <classname>RegistrationPropertyValidator</classname>
            there. We will keep the default value. See
            <xref linkend="custom_registration"/>
            for more details. Let's add, however, a registration property called
            <literal>email</literal>. Click "Add property" and enter the appropriate information in the fields,
            providing a description for the registration property that can be used by consumers to figure out its
            purpose:

            <para>
               Registration handling behavior can be customized by users to suit their Producer needs. This is
               accomplished by providing an implementation of the
               <classname>RegistrationPolicy</classname>
               interface. This interface defines methods that are called by Portal's Registration service so that
               decisions can be made appropriately. A default registration policy that provides basic
               behavior is provided and should be enough for most user needs.
            </para>
            <para>
               While the default registration policy provides default behavior for most registration-related aspects,
               there is still one aspect that requires configuration: whether a given value for a registration property
               is acceptable by the WSRP Producer. This is accomplished by plugging a
               <classname>RegistrationPropertyValidator</classname>
               in the default registration policy. This allows users to define their own validation mechanism.

            <para>Defining a registration policy is required for the producer to be correctly configured. This is
               accomplished by specifying the qualified class name of the registration policy. Since we anticipate that
               most users will use the default registration policy, it is possible to provide the class
               name of your custom property validator instead to customize the default registration policy behavior.
               Note that property validators are only used by the default policy.

               <note><para>Since the policy or the validator are defined via their class name and dynamically loaded, it is
                  important that you make sure that the identified class is available to the application server. One way
                  to accomplish that is to deploy your policy implementation as JAR file in your AS instance deploy
                  directory. Note also that, since both policies and validators are dynamically instantiated, they must
                  provide a default, no-argument constructor.</para>

         <title>WSRP validation mode</title>
         <para>The lack of conformance kit and the wording of the WSRP specification leaves room for differing
            interpretations, resulting in interoperability issues. It is therefore possible to encounter issues when
            using consumers from different vendors. We have experienced such issues and have introduced a way to relax
            the validation that our WSRP producer performs on the data provided by consumers to help with
            interoperability by accepting data that would normally be invalid. Note that we only relax our validation
            algorithm on aspects of the specification that are deemed harmless such as invalid language codes.
         </para>
         <para>
            By default, the WSRP producer is configured in strict mode. If you experience issues with a given consumer,
            you might want to try to relax the validation mode. This is accomplished by unchecking the "Use strict WSRP
            compliance." checkbox on the Producer configuration screen.

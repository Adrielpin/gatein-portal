		<title>Overview</title>
		<para>
			The traditional way of rendering a portal page is static, using a templat (usually a jsp page) for each layout (2 columns, 3 columns and so on). This method depends on the integrator or developers as each new layout will need a custom development.
		</para>
		<para>
			&PRODUCT; has a dynamic rendering method which creates a tree of nested UI containers that contain portlets (as shown in the image below).
		</para>
		<para>
			Each container is responsible for rendering its children. In the below example the main container renders its children in several rows while the nested container displays them as columns.
		</para>
		<para>
			By manipulating the tree using a WYSIWYG editor new containers can be added, their child rendering can be defined and new portlets can be nested.

		<title>Advanced Drag and Drop mechanism</title>
		<para>
			As most portals use the static layout mechanism, portlets can only be dragged from one static location, such as a column, to another static location.
		</para>
		<para>
			In &PRODUCT;, it is possible to drag UI containers (and their portlets) and drop them in containers that are higher or lower in the Portal component tree. This feature is unique to &PRODUCT;

	<title>Permission levels</title>
	<para>There are two permission types:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<emphasis role="bold">Access Permission</emphasis>
			: allows users to use (see a page content, drag and drop portlets
			into pages, sign in). The access permission can be set for a list of
			groups.
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<emphasis role="bold">Edit Permission</emphasis>
			: allows users to change (change portal or page information, delete
			portals or pages). The edit permission is set for only one group at
			the same time.
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
	<para>There are several permission levels:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<emphasis role="bold">Portal</emphasis>
			: The portal includes all pages, pages only can be accessed if the
			user has also access to the Portal.
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<emphasis role="bold">Page</emphasis>
			: You can restrict the access permission to single pages. Users can
			change page information (properties, layout) if they have the edit
			permission.
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<emphasis role="bold">Portlet</emphasis>
			: When users create a page, they need to drag and drop portlets into
			a page to create the page content. Some portlets are only used for
			administrators, some are used for individual needs of a group thus
			you have to set the appropriate access permission.
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>

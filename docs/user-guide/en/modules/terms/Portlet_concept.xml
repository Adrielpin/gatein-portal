	<title>Portlet concept</title>
	<para>A portlet is a web application. Portlets are
			pluggable user interface components that are managed and displayed in
			a portal. Portlets produce fragments of markup code aggregated into a
			portal page. Typically, a portal page is displayed as a collection of
			non-overlapping portlet windows, where each portlet window displays a
			portlet. Hence a portlet (or collection of portlets) resembles a
			web-based application hosted in a portal. The content generated by a
			portlet can vary from one user to another depending on the user who
			configures that portlet.</para>
	<para>GateIn has created standard portlets that can be plugged
		into any portal.</para>

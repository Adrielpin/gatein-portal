		<para>
			A portlet is a small, self-contained web application. Portlet interface components are managed and displayed within a Portal. Typically, a portal page is displayed as a collection of non-overlapping portlet windows, with each portlet window displaying a different portlet. Hence a portlet (or collection of portlets) resembles a web-based application hosted in a portal. Portlets can be configured to generated differing content.

		<para>
			EPP has a number of standard portlets that can be plugged into any portal.

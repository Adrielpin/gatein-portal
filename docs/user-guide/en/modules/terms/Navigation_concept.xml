	<title>Navigation concept</title>
	<para>A  navigation is a menu that helps users to
			visualize the structure of a site and provides hyper links to quickly
			move from page to page. There is a bar which contains navigations
			called Navigation bar. There are three navigation types:</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<emphasis role="bold">Portal navigation</emphasis>
			: This navigation type is used to keep the links to pages of Portal.
			Each portal has only one navigation and it is automatically created
			when a portal is created.
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<emphasis role="bold">Group navigation</emphasis>
			: All registered users are organized in groups. There is a navigation
			keeping the links to all pages of each group, called group
			navigation.
		</listitem>
		<listitem>
			<emphasis role="bold">User navigation</emphasis>
			: Each user has own navigation that keeps the links to pages. User's
			navigation is created automatically like Navigation of Portal when
			user is created (registered). This navigation only can be deleted
			when the user is deleted.

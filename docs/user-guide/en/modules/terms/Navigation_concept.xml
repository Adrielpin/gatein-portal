	  <varlistentry>
		<term>Site</term>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				This navigation links to separate sites of the main Portal. Each site has only one navigation and it is automatically created when the site is created. This functionality allows different sites to administer some Portal aspects individually, such as portlets, while maintaining other content standardized with the parent Portal.

		<term>Group</term>
		<listitem>

				The content of this navigation differs depending on the type of account logged in. For user accounts the Groups navigation holds personal links set up by the user. For management accounts, it keeps the links to pages for registered Portal users as well as administrative tasks and personal links.

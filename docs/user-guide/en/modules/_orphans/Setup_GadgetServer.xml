	<para>GateIn recommend you to setup 2 different virtual hosts
		because it's the basis of the security model of gadgets. Having the
		gadget running on a different domain than the container (the website
		that 'contains' the app), the gadget can't read / modify / do anything
		nasty to GateIn Portal (like adding spam messages, stealing your
		cookies, whatever).</para>

		For example you can server the portal from

    --><title>RTL Support (Right To Left)</title>
	<para>
		GateIn Portal supports RTL (Right to Left) to meet the demand of Arabian customers who want to use the Portal by their own language for more convenient and easy to use. When you change from other languages to Arabic or set the displaying language as Arabic, the displaying on Portal will be changed to Right to Left (RTL) direction because Arabian usually read from Right to Left.
